Title:
DOTA2 Pro Match Prediction

Abstract:
In this project, we use machine learning techniques to predict the result of pro DOTA2
matches based on the heroes selected by each team after the pick and ban phase. We employed
various models, including neural networks, decision trees, and random forest, to analyze
historical data from DOTA2. After comparing the accuracy of each model, we found that the
random forest model gave the best prediction results with an accuracy of 51.4%. We also
investigated the counter relationship between heroes and found that considering this factor could
improve the accuracy of the model to 58.3%. Our model's prediction is consistent and robust,
and it can be used to help the DOTA2 community and players to have a more interactive game.
